# List of ideas

## general service
- getInput with allowness to return empty string
  (Differentiate between corrected input and empty input)

## bahn-service
- Save the first and the last connection. If asked for earlier or later once,
  then print without the one we potentially already printed.
  (If searched for departure, use departure time, and if searched for arrival, use arrival time, for comparision.)
- KG is saved, so it would be possible to save favourites
  - favourite stations
  - favourite connections
- Once the server is able to call by itself, it would be possible
  to make automatic API calls and send the data to the machine at specific time
